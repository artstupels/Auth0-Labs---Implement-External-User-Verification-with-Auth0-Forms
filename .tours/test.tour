To verify, you can try logging in as the same user and see that the Form is not rendered again.\n1. For the next test, set `isPrivateBetaUser` property to `false`.

When debugging an Action script, you should use the [Actions Real-time Logs](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/actions-real-time-logs \"https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/actions-real-time-logs\"), which includes all console.log output and exceptions.\n\n2.  If you run into any issues with Auth0 Forms Flows, you should check for errors in the Flows [Execution and Debugger](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/forms/flows/flow-execution-and-debugger \"https://auth0.com/docs/customize/forms/flows/flow-execution-and-debugger\").\n\n3.  For any issues during the Authentication, you should access [Tenant Logs](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/logs/view-log-events \"https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/logs/view-log-events\").\n\n4. You can also download the Form we were creating in this Lab from here [PrivateBetaFormExported.json](./code_snippets/PrivateBetaFormExported.json). It's in JSON format and can be imported when you start over from **+ Create Form**",
